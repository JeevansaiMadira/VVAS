Application Design
===================

``Smart Model Select`` application design has a platform and integrated accelerator functions. 
Platform is nothing but collection of hardware as well as software components required to build a solution. 
Prebuilt design for ``Smart Model Select`` has been provided as part of this VVAS release. 
You may download this ready to use design by following the link :ref:`Download pre-built binaries <prebuilt_binaries>` and 
directly jump to :ref:`Preparing Setup <preparing_setup>` section describing how to prepare the setup and execute the example application. 

If for some reason, one wants to build the design from scratch, then refer to the section :ref:`Build Design <build_platform>` that describes the steps to build the platform, accelerator functions and finally integrate these to create complete Design for `Smart Model Select` application.

.. Note::

    VVAS platform ``zcu104_vcuDec_DP`` may not be performance optimal. This platform is made available as reference along with `Smart Model Select Application`.


.. _prebuilt_binaries:

In case user wants to see the Licenses and source code that was used to build these pre-built binaries, download `Source Licenses and Source Code(TBD) <TBD>`_ that contain the Open-Source Licenses and source code.

Once you have downloaded the prebuilt binaries, you need to prepare the setup to execute the application, as shown in the next section.

.. _preparing_setup:

********************
Preparing the setup
********************

It is assumed that all the pre-requisites are fulfilled, and we are ready to setup the board and execute the example application. There are few steps that are required only for the first time when the ``zcu104`` board is not flashed with the sd_card image for ``smart_model_select`` application. You may skip these steps if ``zcu104`` board has already been flashed with the required sd_card image.

One time setup
===============

* Flash the SD Card with the ``sd_card.img`` using any SD card flashing tool like dd, Win32DiskImager, or BalenaEtcher.

  If using pre-built binaries, then sd_card.img is located as
  ::
  
    <PREBUILT_BINARIES>/vvas_smart_model_select_2022.2_zcu104/sd_card.img

  If you have built the platform yourself, then sd_card.img would be located at
  ::
  
     <VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-examples/Embedded/smart_model_select/binary_container_1/sd_card.img


* Insert this SD card in the SD card slot on the zcu104 board and boot the board.

* After booting up the board, run below command to extend the root filesystem partition to its 100% size. This is useful 
  in copying input video streams and storing output files from example application.

  .. code-block::

     resize-part /dev/mmcblk0p2

* Copy the `<PREBUILT_BINARIES>/vvas_smart_model_select_2022.2_zcu104/app` folder of the application onto `home` folder of the board.

  .. code-block::

     scp -r <PREBUILT_BINARIES>/vvas_smart_model_select_2022.2_zcu104/app root@<board ip>:~/

* After copying, ``chmod`` `~/app/setup.sh` and `~/app/smart_model_select` to make them executable on the board.

  .. code-block::

     chmod 777 ~/app/smart_model_select
     chmod 777 ~/app/setup.sh

* Create `/usr/share/vitis_ai_library/models` folder on the board and copy the Vitis-AI models into it::

     mkdir -p /usr/share/vitis_ai_library/models
     scp -r <PREBUILT_BINARIES>/vvas_smart_model_select_2022.2_zcu104/models/* root@<board ip>/usr/share/vitis_ai_library/models/



************************
Running the application
************************

This section will elaborate on the usage of the application and various options with it.

Every time the board is booted, execute the steps mentioned below

*  Run `setup.sh` on the board, this will set the alpha channel of the display port and copy label json files related 
   to each model.

   .. code-block::

      cd /home/root/app/
      ./setup.sh

*  Export the environment variable “XCLBIN_PATH” with path pointing to xclbin. If it is not exported, `/media/sd-mmcblk0p1/dpu.xclbin` will be the default xclbin path.

*  Run the command to execute the application
   .. code-block::

      ./smart_model_select

When the application starts executing, you can observe the Fig 1 coming up in the display. This menu displays various models supported by the application and options on either side of the image are for input sources and output sinks supported. All these options carry an index number alongside, which user need to enter in sequence to create the pipeline of choice.

.. image:: ../images/ExampleAppMenu.png

Fig 1: Menu image of the application

Below command line prompt will appear on console/command prompt when the application starts, which will accept the input options for creating the GStreamer pipeline of choice. As described below, user must enter four options in the sequence of input source, ML model to be used, output sink and a field to enable/disable performance mode. Example the sequence “1,2,3,0”, tells that the source is “filesrc”, ML model to be used is “resnet18”, sink is “kmssink” and 0 is to disable performance mode. 

.. code-block::

       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
       Menu displayed on the monitor shows various options available
       for input source, ML model, output sink. Each option carries an
       index number alongside. 
       Select elements to be used in the pipeline in the sequence of 
       "input source, ML model, output sink and performance 
       mode flag" separated by commas.  
       e.g. input: 1,1,3,0
       Above input will run "filesrc" input, "resnet50" model 
       "kmssink" used as output sink and performance mode disabled.
       Enter 'q' to exit
       XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

.. note::

        If performance mode is enabled, then the sink type should always be ``fakesink``. Otherwise, pipeline will not execute.
        
        If performance mode is enabled, there will be 4 ML pipelines executed simultaneously feeding DPU from multiple threads. This results in improved performance compared to when using DPU from single thread.

        In the GStreamer pipelines in this application, Sync is disabled. Which means frames are sent to the display at the rate at which these are processed by pipeline. Hence for smaller resolution streams, you may observe that frames are displayed at faster than real time rate.

Followed by the selection of ML model, source and sink elements, next step is the option to provide input filename or RTSP URL as applicable, to be processed.

If the selected input is file source, then by default application will look for the input video files under `app/videos` folder. 
Create the folder ``/home/root/app/videos`` and copy the video files here with names given below.

.. code-block::

       videos/
       +-- CLASSIFICATION.mp4
       +-- FACEDETECT.mp4
       +-- PLATEDETECT.mp4
       +-- REFINEDET.mp4
       +-- SSD.mp4
       +-- YOLOV2.mp4
       +-- YOLOV3.mp4

If the file is not available in this folder, then application will prompt for the input file. All files must be named after ML model type as given below.
User has to enter the input file location in response to the below message prompt. 

.. code-block::

      Enter the input filename to be processed

If the selected input source is “RTSP”, then application will prompt for entering "RTSP" URL.

.. code-block::

      Enter the RTSP url to be processed

The application supports RTSP input with RTP packets containing H264 payload of resolution 1920x1080. One can download and setup GStreamer RTSP server or VLC can also be used to serve RTSP data. Follow below mentioned steps to compile GStreamer RTSP server. For successful compilation of GStreamer RTSP server, GStreamer framework must be installed as a prerequisite.

.. code-block::

      1.  wget https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-rtsp-server/gst-rtsp-server-1.18.5.tar.xz
      2.  tar -xvf gst-rtsp-server-1.18.5.tar.xz
      3.  cd gst-rtsp-server-1.18.5/
      4.  ./autogen.sh --disable-gtk-doc
      5.  make

Examples in gst-rtsp-server-1.18.5/examples can be used to serve RTSP data. Refer below example

.. code-block::

      cd gst-rtsp-server-1.18.5/examples
      ./test-launch  "filesrc location=<Absolute Path of File with H264 1080p in MP4 format> ! qtdemux  ! h264parse ! rtph264pay name=pay0 pt=96"

Streaming starts on the URL rtsp://<RTSP server ip adress>:8554/test. Enter the same URL as input to the application.

Application supports multiple sink options as well. If ``kmssink`` is used, output video will be rendered on the display monitor connected. If ``filesink`` is chosen, the output will get dumped to a file by name “output.nv12” in the current directory. On the other hand, ``fakesink`` acts a black hole for the data with no overhead.


Below Fig 2 is the pictorial depiction of a typical pipeline that is created by the application.

.. _build_platform:

*************
Build Design
*************

The Design consists of a base platform and integrated accelerator functions (Kernels).


Base Platform
==============

``Smart Model Select`` application requires video decoding, resizing the decoded frames, Machine Learning and finally display the output. Hence, we need a platform that fulfills these requirements. This VVAS release has ``zcu104_vcuDec_DP`` base platform that meets the requirements of decode and display. This platform has hardware accelerated video decoding IP, Video Codec Unit ``VCU``. For display, this platform supports ``Display Port``. The design also includes two DPU 4096 cores for Machine Learning.

In addition to the above-mentioned hardware components, ``zcu104_vcuDec_DP`` supports following software components

* omxh264dec GStreamer plugin
* Opensource framework like GStreamer, OpenCV
* Vitis AI 3.0 libraries
* Xilinx Run Time (XRT)


Compiling base platform
========================

Complete sources along with workspace to build the platform is provided as part of this release. 
Follow the steps mentioned below to compile the platform.


1. Navigate to the folder, such as ``VVAS_SOURCES``, where you want to clone the VVAS source tree.

2. Clone VVAS repo::
   
      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Xilinx/VVAS.git
         
3. Setup tool chain environment::

      source <2022.2_Vitis>/settings64.sh
      source <2022.2_Petalinux>/settings.sh
      source <2022.2_Vivado>/setenv.sh
       
4. Navigate to ``zcu104_vcuDec_DP`` platform folder::

      cd <VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-platforms/Embedded/zcu104_vcuDec_DP

5. Compile the platform::
      
      make

.. _platform_path:

After build is finished, platform will be available ``<VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-platforms/Embedded/zcu104_vcuDec_DP/platform_repo/xilinx_zcu104_vcuDec_DP_202220_1/export/xilinx_zcu104_vcuDec_DP_202220_1/`` location.

Hardware Accelerators (Kernels)
================================

``Smart Model Select`` application's requirements of Machine Learning and Resize operations are fulfilled by below mentioned accelerators (Kernels):

*  ``DPU`` (Deep Learning Processing Unit) for Machine Learning.
*  ``Image Processing`` for Preprocessing operation


******************************************
Compiling Hardware Accelerators (Kernels)
******************************************

The sources for hardware accelerators required for ``Smart Model Select`` application can be made available as mentioned below:

1. Navigate to <VVAS_SOURCES>

2. DPU Kernel sources can be obtained by following steps as below:

  * Open the `reference_design <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/master/dpu#readme>`__ readme page from Vitis-AI release repo.

  * Copy the **Reference Design** link for **IP Name** corresponding to ``DPUCZDX8G`` from ``Edge IP`` Table::

      wget -O DPUCZDX8G_VAI_v3.0.tar.gz '<Download Link>'

  * Unarchive ``DPUCZDX8G_VAI_v3.0.tar.gz`` ::

      tar -xf DPUCZDX8G_VAI_v3.0.tar.gz


3. Image Processing kernel sources are part of VVAS source tree and are located at::

      <VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-accel-hw/image_processing

Kernels may have different configurations for different application requirements. Hence it is recommended to build the Kernels from the application design workspace with the required Kernel configuration for that application. 

Each application design workspace provided with this VVAS release has the required Kernel configurations for that application. 

In case one wants to change the kernel configuration for some reason, do these changes in the configuration files mentioned below. 

.. note::

   Compilation of Kernels is initiated from the build process of the final design for the application. Hence kernel compilation steps are not covered separately here.


DPU Kernel for this example design is configured for B4096 architecture. Configuration file used can be found at ``<VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-examples/Embedded/multichannel_ml/dpu_conf.vh``.

Image Processing IP/Kernel source code can be refered from ``<VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-accel-hw/image_processing/``. For this example design Image Processing kernel is configured for max-width:1920, max-height:1080 and format support of Y_UV8_420, RGB and BGR. Configuration file used can be found at ``<VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-examples/Embedded/multichannel_ml/image_processing_config.h``.

You may modify the kernel configuration as per your requirements in corresponding configuration files.


***********************
Creating SD Card image
***********************

Once platform is built, next step is to compile and stitch the required hardware accelerators (kernels) into the platform and generate final SD Card image using Vitis Flow.

VVAS sources already has ready to build example Vitis workspace for ``smart_model_select`` Application. This workspace uses Vitis Flow that stitches kernels into the platform and generates final SD card image. Follow below mentioned steps to build the final image.

.. code-block::

      cd <VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-examples/Embedded/smart_model_select
      make PLATFORM=<PLATFORM_PATH> DPU_TRD_PATH=<DPU_PATH> HW_ACCEL_PATH=<IMAGE_PROCESSING_PATH>
      
      PLATFORM_PATH=<VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-platforms/Embedded/zcu104_vcuDec_DP/platform_repo/xilinx_zcu104_vcuDec_DP_202220_1/export/xilinx_zcu104_vcuDec_DP_202220_1/xilinx_zcu104_vcuDec_DP_202220_1.xpfm

      DPU_PATH=<VVAS_SOURCES>/DPUCZDX8G_VAI_v3.0

      IMAGE_PROCESSING_PATH=<VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-accel-hw

Once above build is done, final sdcard image is available at ``./binary_container_1/sd_card.img`` location.

.. _build_vvas_plugins_and_libs:

**********************************
Build VVAS Plug-ins and Libraries
**********************************

VVAS Plugins and libraries are part of petalinux bsp and are built along with building platform. So, no need to build again. Still if one wants to build these for some reason, follow the steps mentioned below,


Setting Sysroot
================

Sysroot is required to build the VVAS GStreamer plugins. Sysroot installer location depends on whether you are using pre-built binaries, or you have built the platform from scratch.

If you have downloaded the pre-built binaries in folder, say ``PREBUILT_BINARIES``, then you can find the Sysroot installer at::

   <PREBUILT_BINARIES>/vvas_smart_model_select_2022.2_zcu104/sdk.sh


If you have built the platform yourself, then Sysroot installer is available at::

   <VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-platforms/Embedded/zcu104_vcuDec_DP/platform_repo/tmp/sw_components/sdk.sh


One need to install the sysroot. Create a folder, say **sysroot** in `VVAS_SOURCES`. Command for sysroot generation is::

   <path to sdk.sh>/sdk.sh -y -d VVAS_SOURCES/sysroot/

Now sysroot is installed. You are ready to build plugins and applications.


Build Plugins and Libraries
============================

Get the VVAS Sources if not done already. Follow the steps mentioned below.

* Navigate to the folder, say ``VVAS_SOURCES``, where you want to clone the VVAS source tree.

* Clone VVAS repo::
  
     git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Xilinx/VVAS.git


  VVAS Source tree structure is described below:

  .. figure:: ../images/vvas_source_tree_structure.png
     :width: 300

  * **vvas-utils:** This folder contains the source code for the VVAS kernel interface to be exposed by the acceleration software libraries, abstraction APIs on top of the Xilinx Runtime (XRT) tool, and common headers (for example, metadata).
  * **vvas-core:** This folder contains the source code of core APIs.

  * **vvas-gst-plugins:** This folder contains all the VVAS GSteamer plug-ins, including the infrastructure plug-ins and the Custom plug-ins.

  * **vvas-accel-sw-libs:** Contains source for the acceleration software libraries that are called from the GStreamer infrastructure plug-ins.

  * **vvas-accel-hw:** This folder contains the hardware kernel source code.

  * **vvas-examples:** This repository hosts example solutions.

  * **vvas-platforms:** This folder contains the reference platforms for different applications.


* Navigate to ``VVAS_SOURCES/VVAS`` folder

* Unset the LD library path environment variable::
 
     unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* Set the sysroot path::

     source VVAS_SOURCES/sysroot/environment-setup-cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux

  You must have write permission to the sysroot.


* Build VVAS plugins and libraries::

   ./build_install_vvas.sh TARGET=Edge

* When above step is complete, VVAS plugins are generated as ``install/vvas_installer.tar.gz``.

* Copy ``install/vvas_installer.tar.gz`` onto the root folder (/) of the target board and untar it. VVAS Plugins are now installed on the target device.


Build Smart Model Select Application
=====================================

The example application (smart_model_select) is available in the “vvas-example” section of VVAS repository. Follow below steps to compile the application::

   cd <VVAS_SOURCES>/VVAS/vvas-examples/Embedded/smart_model_select/src
   unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   source <sysroot path>/environment-setup-cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux
   make

*************
Known Issues
*************

* On zcu104 boards, Cascaded pipelines OR several ML instances running simultaneously are sending board into bad state and needs reboot to recover from it. The default value of IOUT_OC_FAULT_LIMIT on PMIC chip irps5401 is too low and that is causing the temperature fault limit getting crossed. Workaround is to increase this limit. But there is risk of board getting damaged if running for long time.
