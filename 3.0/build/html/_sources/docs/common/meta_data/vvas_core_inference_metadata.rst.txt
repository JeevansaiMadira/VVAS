VVAS Core Inference Meta Data Structures
##############################################

This section covers details about ``VVAS Core`` Meta Data structures to host inference meta data produced by the machine learning (ML) inference acceleration software libraries. This metadata structure stores the inferred data generated at multiple levels of ML operation into a single structure in a hierarchical way. This data structure combines, and stores metadata generated by detection and classification models.
