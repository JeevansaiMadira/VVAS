===============

The tracker plug-in tracks detected objects in a sequence of video frames. Because tracking is easier than detection, tracking algorithms can use fewer computational resources 
than running an object detector on every frame and hence finds many applications.

Each tracker element in the frame is given a unique ID and is initialized with the coordinates of the object detected by ML block. 
The object is snipped from the frame and taken as a template. Afterwards, the tracker element updates the filter every time that there is an object hit, 
adapting itself to the possible changes which an object might have during the video. 

The tracker plug-in supports three types of object tracking algorithms, namely **Intersection-Over-Union (IOU), Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF) and 
Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error (MOSSE)**.  IOU algorithm is used when detection output is available for every frame.  
Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF) algorithm or Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error (MOSSE) filter algorithm implemented completely in software 
using optimizations for the host processor.

Tracker plugin supports tracking up to 16 objects. Tracker Id starts from 0 and supported till MAX_INT32, -1 will be used when Id is not aaigned yet by tracker.

This pipeline depicts the typical multi-stream usecase where, multiple streams are muxed by funnel element to form a batch for inference.
With tracker in the pipeline, not all the frames are required to be fed for inference. :ref:`vvas_xskipframe` plugin controls the rate at which the frames needs to be sent for inference.
:ref:`vvas_xreorderframe` plugin receives the frames that are inferred and that are skipped and arranges them in the correct order of presentation before forwarding frames downstream.

Optionally, if less CPU is available on the host, the frames can be scaled to lower resolution (can be scaled to model resolution or nearest resolution that maintains aspect ratio) before submitting to Tracker so as to avoid CPU load of Tracker algorithm that requires to work on larger areas if not scaled down.

The frames in the correct order are presented to :ref:`vvas_xtracker` plugin to track the objects that were detected by inference.
Tracker waits for object to be found in multiple frames before assigning Tracker Id to it and attaches the tracked bounding box information in the GstBuffer metadata.

If video resolution is scaled down for tracker, metaaffixer plugin should be added to the pipeline to scale the bounding box co-ordinates received from tracker to original video resolution. 
Metaaffixer scales and updates the Inference metadata to original video resolution and pushes the frames downstream.

Downstream plugins read the bounding box information of the objects from inference metadata attached to the GstBuffer and does further processing.


The :ref:`vvas_xskipframe`, :ref:`vvas_xreorderframe` and :ref:`vvas_xtracker` are multi-stream aware and supports buffers of multiple streams on their sink and source GstPads.
